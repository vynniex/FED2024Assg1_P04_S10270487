# THE MOVIE CORNER - FED2024Assg1_P04_S10270487

This project is dedicated to showcasing the movie "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince", the sixth film in the iconic Harry Potter series written by J.K Rowling. The website provides an in-depth overview of the movie, including a detailed plot summary, cast profiles, and scenes from the movie itself. The goal was to create a central hub where visitors can gain more insight on the movie in a visually engaging and informative way.

## Design Process
Viewing the project from a user's perspective, I wanted to ensure that users could easily find information on the movie like its air date, duration, casting, etc. This ensures that interested users are supplied with easily attainable yet accurate information on the movie provided. When I first came up with my wireframes (PDF provided in Wireframes folder or click on 
[Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/design/8xroCnJa8dRcamgmLVH45u/FED-ASG1?node-id=0-1&t=zKfrVOISSoTO7ksP-1 "Figma")),
I had intended to make it practical so that it was user friendly and easy to understand. It takes minimal effort to understand what the website does and it allows users to find out more about the actors/actresses that were casted with ease.

## Features
### Existing Features
* Feature 1 - NAVIGATION BAR
  * The navigation bar links to 3 different pages - HOME, CAST, and MORE. A feature I had implemented was that when the user is on  a certain page (e.g HOME), the HOME word in the navigation bar will be underlined and turned a different colour so that it is easier for the user to know which page they are currently on. Furthermore, there is a slight hover effect when the user mouses their cursor over the words in the navigation bar.

* Feature 2 - EXTERNAL LINK TO CAST PROFILE
  * Every cast photo on the website leads to an external link of their profiles when clicked. There is also a slight hover effect when the user mouses their cursor over the photos, making it visible that the photos are meant to be interactive as well as clearly highlighting which cast photo they are interacting with currently.

* Feature 3 - SHOW MORE (index.html) AND BACK (allcast.html) BUTTONS
  * The SHOW MORE button is located at the bottom of index.html to provide users with ease of access. They are able to press that button to move onto the CAST page without having to scroll back up to the navigation bar. Similarly, for allcast.html, the BACK button is also located at the bottom of the CAST page, which brings users back to the HOME page.

* Feature 4 - PHOTOS SLIDESHOW
  * On the MORE page, there is a small slideshow of scenes from the movies. Initially it was meant to be just 4 photos but after thinking it through, I had decided to change it into a slideshow as it seems more aesthetically pleasing and it showcases each individual scene thoroughly.

* Feature 5 - OFFICIAL WIKIPEDIA LINK
  * At the bottom of the MORE page, there is the words "Official Wikipedia" that, when clicked on, will open up an external link to the official wikipedia for Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. This makes it easier for users that want to have an even more in-depth information on the movie.

### Features that can be implemented in the future
* Integrating Movie Trailer
  * Many movies include their trailers as a way to nab viewers' attentions. Integrating a movie trailer can help increase the site's aesthetic and informative points.
* Other movies in the same franchise
  * As someone who has watched all the movies in the Harry Potter franchise, I know that including all the remaining 7 films in a seperate area on the website can increase viewer curiosity as they would want to find out more on the entire franchise itself.

## Testing
1. Cast Profiles
    1. Go to any cast's photo
    2. Click on the photo
    3. Verify that an external link containing the cast's profile opens on a new tab
2. Mobile & Desktop View
    1. On both desktop & mobile, the cast photos should fit as many photos it can, spanning from the left side to the right, with small padding on the sides. Mobile should contain 2-3 photos per row, while Desktop should contain 5-6 per row.
    2. On both desktop & mobile, the movie banner on index.html should fit and be displayed nicely.

### Acknowledgements
* I received inspiration for this project from my love of watching anime/movies in my free time, and the characters that I have been intrigued by. I was also amazed by how organised some movie websites can be regardless of the tens and thousands of movies there are in the world.
